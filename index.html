    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>El Maven is an open source, vendor neutral, LC-MS data processing engine that is most optimal for isotopomer labeling and untargeted metabolomic profiling experiments. Currently Maven exists as a desktop application that runs on <a href="main/2016/02/12/windows-installation.html">Windows</a> and <a href="main/2016/02/12/ubuntu-installation.html">Ubuntu</a>. The aim of this software package is to reduce complexity of metabolomics analysis by using a highly intitute interface for exploring and validating metabolomics data.</p>
    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The birth of El Maven can be traced back to another open source project, <a href="http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/mzroll/index.php">Maven</a>, an open source LC-MS data processing engine developed by Euguene Melamud. We decided to use El Maven as the working title for the current project for few reasons. One, we wanted to acknowledge the original project. We also want to commit ourselves to create “The” version of Maven that is widely used and supported by the community. Finally, El also bears the stamp of Elucidata.</p>
